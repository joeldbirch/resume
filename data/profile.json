  "summary": "Originally a self-taught designer, my craving for new tools to master lead full circle back to a childhood interest: coding. The web standards movement of the mid-2000s presented a perfect opportunity to meld proven design chops with this rediscovered passion. The death of the Flash platform had left design agencies struggling to create rich, cross-browser web experiences, so I quickly took over all website development at the advertising agencies I freelanced at, resulting in a firehose of client websites to build with ever-increasing feature complexity.\n\nI live and thrive in the space between creative and technical minds, facilitating the smooth communication of ideas between the two groups. I love the constant learning necessary to be able to provide, in effect, a turnkey digital solution for agencies that otherwise couldn't offer professional web services to their clients.\n\nIf I had to choose my most valuable and defining feature it would be my ability and drive to learn. I recently learnt to ride a motorcycle, cut my own hair and complete the Rubix Cube (although admittedly not all in the same day). My very minor “internet fame” comes from developing the ubiquitous Superfish dropdown menu plugin during the early days of the jQuery boom.",

I designed and developed the user-facing interface for (initially) Volkswagen dealerships to use, allowing them to quickly create and publish print advertisements from adaptive InDesign templates which I created to match their style guide specifications, regardless of the media space it filled. I handled all UI design and front-end development in addition to researching and implementing the InDesign Server scripting engine that formed the heart of the functionality.\n\nI also conceived of, designed, built and successfully presented to Volkswagen Australia headquarters, a system for individual Volkswagen dealer websites to be run from a WordPress multisite installation, winning Hubink millions of dollars of income.",

      "description": "Superfish is an enhanced Suckerfish-style menu jQuery plugin that takes an existing pure CSS drop-down menu (so it degrades gracefully without JavaScript) and adds many much-sought-after enhancements to improve the user experience.\n\nIn 2006, dropdown menus were problematic as it was hard to get all the interaction details right without creating a usability nightmare. Flash had often handled such interactions prior to this, but the rise of web standards demanded a more accessible solution using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I authored and maintained the Open Source plugin in order to provide a reliable cross-browser dropdown system supporting browsers from as early as Internet Explorer 5, right through to current browsers. This included a major rewrite as touch screens became ubiquitous.\n\nSuperfish was first released in 2007 to a tiny jQuery mailing list, many members of which became official jQuery team members. I would guess it to be one of the most commonly used dropdown plugins on the web, even doing service on the official White House website and Barack Obama's own website.\n\nThe plugin is still widely used today, despite a malware product unfortunately deciding to use the same name! I no longer use the plugin myself as I find modern CSS capable of providing most, if not all of the features it provided.",
