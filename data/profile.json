  "summary": "Originally a self-taught designer whose craving for new tools to master lead me full circle back to a childhood interest: coding. The web standards movement of the mid-2000s presented me with the perfect opportunity to meld my proven design chops with my rediscovered coding passion and to fill void that the death of the Flash platform left for design agencies attempting to create rich web experiences. I quickly took over all website development at the advertising agencies I freelanced at, which provided a steady stream of client websites to build with ever-increasing feature complexity. I loved the constant learning necessary to be able to provide, in effect, a turnkey digital solution for agencies that otherwise couldn't offer professional web services to their clients.\n\nIf I had to choose my most valuable and defining feature it would be my ability and drive to learn.\n\nMy very minor “internet fame” comes from developing the ubiquitous Superfish dropdown menu plugin during the early days of jQuery’s birth.",
