  "summary": "I’m a self-taught designer whose craving for new tools to master lead me full circle to a childhood interest: coding. The web standards movement of the mid-2000s presented me with the perfect opportunity to meld my proven design chops with my rediscovered coding passion. I quickly took over all website development at the advertising agencies I freelanced at, which provided a steady stream of client websites to build with ever-increasing feature complexity. I loved the constant learning involved with the need to be, in effect, a turnkey digital solution for agencies that otherwise couldn't offer professional web services to their clients.\n\nIf I had to choose my most valuable and defining feature it would be my ability and drive to learn.\n\nMy very minor “internet fame” comes from developing the ubiquitous Superfish dropdown menu plugin during the early days of jQuery’s birth.",
